# usyvlToolsPortal
This is basically a minimal portal website to support a suite of usyvl tools.

It has recently (2023-05-31) been re-organized to include a public_html directory that contains the website components.  This will allow us to keep non-web resources (git repo, Makefile, scripts) out of the document root.  In the past additional usyvl resources (workflow, scheduling, mobile, etc...) were deployed in subfolders of the document root.  Am now thinking about possible ways to handle that differently (ie: a single subfolder for external repos???)
